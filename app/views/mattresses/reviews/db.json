We've slept on it for about 3 weeks now and couldn't be more satisfied. It is the perfect firmness and support for someone with backaches. My sleeping has improved so much, it's hard to get out of bed. The wife loves that mattress stays cool through the night. Customer service was terrific and it was delivered same day! Simply the best!
