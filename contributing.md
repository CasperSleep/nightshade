# Contribute


## Code Style

We think it's best for the project if the code you write looks like the code the last developer wrote, so we've put together some guidelines we ask that you follow. We greatly appreciate your cooperation and contribution.


## Pull Request Guidelines

- Develop in a topic branch (not `master`)
- If your PR is not related to an issue, write a descriptive title
- Add a description to your PR

If you are developing towards a new release, submit your PR towards the
release branch.

If you are submitting a patch, submit a PR towards the `master` branch.

**@TODO** Expand how to update version for you release.

## Submitting New Ideas

We love new ideas. Please use the issue queue to submit your suggestions.


## Browser Compatibility

Modern browser (latest: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE9)


## Semantic Versioning

Ando uses Semver. Here is a [good primer](http://www.sitepoint.com/semantic-versioning-why-you-should-using/) for how Ando tags releases.
